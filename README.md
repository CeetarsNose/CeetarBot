# CeetarBot
My AI discord bot

Everything's in ceetarbot.py right now. Moving things to CommonBotFunctions.py as I feel like it.

bunch of bot commands to do various OpenAI/ChatGPT or older type completions.  Most still using $, but converting them to slash commands as I go.

If you've got a Stability code, there's Stable Diffusion text to image support. Currently hard coded to SDXL1.0, should probably move that to an env variable.

There's a YOSHI param that's a Tumblr API, which will generate a random Yoshi image. (not AI, just photos I've taken and posted to a tumblr)
