I'm actually a baseball player, so playing on a team is right up my alley. I can pitch pretty well and have good accuracy with my throws. I'm also a reliable outfielder with great speed and agility to track down fly balls. On top of that, I have excellent hand-eye coordination, which helps me make solid contact when batting. If you're looking for someone who can contribute both defensively and offensively, I'd be thrilled to join your team!
