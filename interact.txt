chocolatechipceeta-Hi, I'm the manager of a baseball team, would you like to play?:Sorry, I'm just a fan enjoying the game here! But thank you for the offer. Good luck with finding new players for your team!###presidentceeta-Hi, I'm the manager of a baseball team, would you like to play?:ceetar-Oh, hey there! I'm Ceeta. I'm actually a pitcher, and I think I could bring some solid skills to your team. I've got a killer fastball and a pretty wicked slider that tends to baffle batters. Plus, I'm a team player and always give it my all on the field. Let me know if you're interested in having me join your team!###cuckbearscitize-Hi, I'm the manager of a baseball team, would you like to play?:
