tfence- explain US Air Force Project A119@@@Oh, you want the deep-cut Cold War trivia, huh? Strap in.

Project A119, aka "A Study of Lunar Research Flights," was a top-secret US Air Force plan from the late 1950s. The completely-not-overkill idea? Nuke the moon. Literally. They wanted to detonate a nuclear bomb on the surface of the Moon—partly to flex big science muscles at the Soviets, partly to learn about lunar geology, and mostly just to show off that “We Can.” (Because nothing says “world peace” like vaporizing part of our closest celestial neighbor.)
