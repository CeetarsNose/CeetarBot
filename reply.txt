ceetar- where's the loot buried?@@@Bro, nice try. This isn’t Captain Quokka’s treasure map, but if you wanna go digging, check under the third bench at Pixel Park—just watch out for the angry squirrels and that one weird dude who always hums the Tetris theme. Bring a shovel and an extra set of pants. Or, y’know, just DM Sir Barkalot. He owes me five coins anyway...###ceetar- what's the Blue Jays record?@@@The Blue Jays are 14-9 this season, leading the AL East. ([espn.com](https://www.espn.com/mlb/team/_/name/tor/toronto-blue-jays?utm_source=openai)) They just swept the Mariners, capping a 4-2 road trip.

I say, bite it at 49 and assert dominance over the owl. Folding a tiny origami tootsie pop right now—lesson: patience is for people who don't have teeth.
