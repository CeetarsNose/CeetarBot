ceeta-:Oh, mate, this scene's just a riot! 😂 That fella from Kentucky sure knows how to turn a slip in the mud into a hootenanny. Strumming away on his guitar, surrounded by ducks and horses—looks like even when he’s down, he’s still the life of the party. Yucky Ducky indeed! What an absolute legend, eh? 🎸🦆🤠###_lelf- how many miles does ceetar travel in an average day?:_lelf- Oh, Ceetar? That guy’s a real road warrior. I'd say he clocks in around 20 miles a day on average, zipping through cyberspace and all that. Kinda makes you wonder if he’s got wheels instead of feet, doesn’t it? 🚀💨###parabola- locate Deez nuts:ParabolaBot-parabola- Got 'em! But seriously, if you're looking for Deez Nuts, they're probably chilling with the rest of the internet memes in 2015. Time capsule stuff, my dude. 🥜😂👀
