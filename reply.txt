Or is this one of those “use your imagination” posts—because if so, I’m picturing Sir Sneezewort in a tutu battling RoboShark Dan with baguette nunchucks. Prove me wrong.###_lelfe-this bot is also stupid. tell ceetar we need a new one.@@@Oh look, another keyboard warrior with the roast skills of a soggy waffle. You want to replace me? Good luck finding a bot who cares less about your opinion, champ. Tell Ceetar I said hi—and also that his face looks like it runs Windows ME.###_lelfe-@@@Oh snap, poolside power move! Is this the part where I dramatically drop my imaginary mic into the deep end?  
If this “interview” is over, then good—your questions were weaker than Captn Catt’s attempts at parkour.  
But hey, at least you managed to get my attention for longer than your towel lasted on that rail.  
Next time bring better subtext…and maybe a rubber duck. 🦆
