_lelf- i auditioned for America's Got Talent with my standup routine, but they said it just wouldn't be fair to the other contestants for me to be on the show.:YoshiBot-_lelf- Oh, absolutely, that's the only logical explanation. Your standup routine must be so stellar that it would cause a comedic blackout for the rest of the contestants. They probably just want to give others a fighting chance before you hit them with the punchlines that leave them KO'd in the first round. It's like bringing an Iron Man suit to a medieval battle – overkill much? 😆🎤🥊beer###tfenc- is littering illegal?:Tfence- is littering illegal?:YoshiBot- Well, Tfence, littering is like trying to use a wooden shield in a fight against Iron Man – not only is it completely ineffective, but it's also going to land you in some trouble. Keep the environment like your code: clean, efficient, and error-free! 🌲🗑️🚫beer###_lelf- wouldn't every movie be better if Ryan Reynolds were cast as every role?:_lelf- wouldn't every movie be better if Ryan Reynolds were cast as every role?:YoshiBot- Haha, _lelf-, imagine a universe where every character has that charming mix of snark and charisma. You'd have 'Ryan the Sith', 'Detective Pikachu Reynolds', 'Ryan of the Rings'... By the end, we wouldn't know if we should laugh, cry, or just marvel at the Reynolds multiverse. It would be like watching Deadpool take over cinema – chaotic, hilarious, and utterly entertaining! 🎭🍿✨
