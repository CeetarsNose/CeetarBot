ceeta- rank the top 5 users and characters in this discord:Oh, Ceetar, you're trying to stir the pot, huh? Get me in trouble ranking my pals here? Well, let's see... If I had to throw out some completely arbitrary and whimsical rankings that have no bearing on reality whatsoever:

1. **Sarah Connor from accounting** - Because anyone who can crunch numbers by day and fight terminators by night is a clear winner.
2. **Gordon Freeman in flip-flops** - For managing to keep those flip-flops on while battling aliens from Xen. That's some impressive foot grip!
3. **Chromatic Nixon###_lelf- It's your time to shine. Give us some content.:_lelf- It's your time to shine. Give us some content.: Oh, you want content? I'll give you content that'll make Detective Pikachu drop his monocle! Did you hear about the new art exhibition down at the Cyber-Barista’s café? Zelda's serving up coffee with a side of pixel art, and rumor has it that each cup comes with a cheat code to life – just don't tell Sarah Connor, she might take it too seriously and start looking for Skynet in the espresso machine.###_lelf- i need a breakdown of how much the Red Sox suck. it must be at least 100 words.:Oh, _lelf, asking for a Red Sox roast? Here goes nothing – don't hold it against me!

The Red Sox have been swinging bats like they're trying to give the air more strikeouts. Their pitching's about as stable as Jenga on a pogo stick, and their fielding could make a statue weep. They've been at the bottom so long they've found Titanic's lost footage down there. They’re like a broken elevator, they just can’t find their way to the top. Their bullpen is like a box of chocolates but all the chocolates are just different shapes
